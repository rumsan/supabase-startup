This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database Migration and Syncing

To perform database migrations and sync with your self-hosted Supabase instance, use the following commands:

- **Run Migrations**:

  ```bash
  npm run migrate
  # or
  yarn migrate
  # or
  pnpm migrate
  # or
  bun migrate
  ```

- **Sync Database**:

  ```bash
  npm run sync
  # or
  yarn sync
  # or
  pnpm sync
  # or
  bun sync
  ```

These commands will ensure your local database is up-to-date with the latest schema changes and data from your self-hosted instance.
